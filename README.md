</p>
<p align="justify">
Ttokenization, stemming and lemmatization are used for exploration of text-based datasets. As for text ummarization Explore state-of-the-art algorithms has been used.
Transformer model has been used and pre-trained model perfomance has been evaluated. Development and deployment of the dashboard are done in Heroku.
